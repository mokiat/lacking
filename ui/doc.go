// Package ui provides types and functions for creating an
// interactive User Interface.
//
// NOTE: Some types are a near perfect clone of similar types from the app
// package. However, there can be subtle differences in the behavior or
// semantic behind them, which is the reason why they are not aliases and
// care should be taken when transitioning between them.
