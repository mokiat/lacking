# Lacking Game Engine [![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/mokiat/lacking)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/mokiat/lacking) [![Go Reference](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/github.com/mokiat/lacking.svg)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/mokiat/lacking)

A 3D game engine / game framework that lacks a lot of features (hence the name).

This project aims to replace [go-whiskey](https://github.com/mokiat/go-whiskey), which has now been archived, by going through a more pragmatic development approach.

This repository is a hobby project of mine that aims to support other hobby projects like [rally-mka](https://github.com/mokiat/rally-mka). There are no plans at the moment to have this become a serious project and as such it lacks proper testing and code cleanliness.

**WARNING:** If you do decide to base a project of yours off of this repository make sure you depend on a specific tagged version, as the `master` branch or new tagged versions are unlikely to be backward compatible.
