# Lacking Game Engine

**WARNING:** This project is under active prototyping.

![logo](logo.png)

A 3D game engine / game framework that lacks a lot of features (hence the name).

This project aims to replace [go-whiskey](https://github.com/mokiat/go-whiskey), which has now been archived.

It is meant to support hobby projects of mine, like [rally-mka](https://github.com/mokiat/rally-mka) with as quick 
iterations as possible so forget about seeing proper clean code and testing.
