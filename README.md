# lacking

Whereas [go-whiskey](https://github.com/mokiat/go-whiskey) is a framework that intends to provide common packages for writing a game, this package intends to extend on that and include tooling for an end-to-end solution. Some of the packages will probably be migrated slowly into this project.

Note: This is just a hobby project and will likely be lacking (hence the name) features / capabilities, compared to what is already on the market.
