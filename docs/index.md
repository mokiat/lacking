This GitHub page contains documentation on the [lacking](https://github.com/mokiat/lacking/) game engine/framework. The framework is divided into a number of core modules as follows:

* [Application](./application/index.md)

    This module allows one to start an application and handle user input (mouse, keyboard, etc.) events.

* [Rendering](./rendering/index.md)

    This module exposes a generic API that can be used to issue render commands to the GPU.

* [User interface](./user-interface/index.md)

    This module provides a user interface framework that is inspired by React. It can be used to construct complex widget hierarchies and display them on the screen.

* [Game](./game/index.md)

    This module contains all the code that is necessary to load, run and visualize a game scene.
