# Terminology

| Symbol | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| $m$ | The [mass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass) of an object. Larger mass means that the object is harder to translate. |
| $a$ | The [acceleration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceleration) of an object. Indicates the rate at which the velocity of an object changes. |
| $v$ | The [velocity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velocity) of an object. Indicates the rate at which the object's position changes. |
| $F$ | The [force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force) acting on an object. |
| $p$ | The [momentum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Momentum) of an object. Can be thought of as the impact potential of the object. |
| $I$ | The [moment of inertia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moment_of_inertia) of an object. Larger moment of inertia means that the object is harder to rotate. It also describes the rotational behavior of an object. |
| $\alpha$ | The [angular acceleration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_acceleration) of an object. Indicates the rate at which the angular velocity of an object changes. |
| $\omega$ | The [angular velocity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_velocity) of an object. Indicates the rate at which the object's rotation changes. |
| $\tau$ | The [torque](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torque) acting on an object. |
| $L$| The [angular momentum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_momentum) of an object. Can be thought of as the rotational impact potential of the object. |
| $\textit{e}$ | The [coefficient of restitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient_of_restitution) of two objects. It describes the bounciness that an object experiences when colliding with another object, where the value differs depending on the characteristics of the two objects. |
| $\mu$ | The [coefficient of friction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friction) of two objects. It describes how hard it is for two objects to slide when in contact, where the value differs depending on the characteristics of the two objects. It also differs depending on whether the two objects are initially at relative rest or are already sliding across each other. |
| $\rho$ | The [density](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density) of a fluid or object. Determines how much mass there is per unit of volume. For a fluid it also determines how hard it is for an object to go through the fluid. |
| $C_d$ | The [drag coefficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drag_coefficient) of an object. It is determined by the shape of an object and is specific to a given orientation of the object. It describes how much an object's shape opposes the object's motion through a fluid or gas. |
| $C_L$ | The [lift coefficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lift_coefficient) of an object. The value depends on the object's shape, material, and the angle at which the fluid or gas hits the object. |
